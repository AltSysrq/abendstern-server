The Abendstern Server is a Tcl dæmon which runs stateful connections with
clients, managing such things as authentication, information sharing, and
Internet games, as well as providing a UDP hole-punching service.

A connection to the local MySQL server is used for data persistence.

Communications are performed over TCP 12544.

The protocol has three overall modes:
+ Plain: Messages are exchanged in plain text. This mode is only used for
  exchanging enough data to enter Secure mode.
+ Secure: Messages are encrypted with AES-128.
+ Data: A temporary mode in which a block of data is exchanged, unencrypted.

Plain mode is used simply to perform a Diffie-Hellman key exchange
(see: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman_key_exchange) and
then switch into Secure mode.

Diffie-Hellman key exchange uses base 5 and the prime number
1451730470513778492236629598992166035067 (40 digits).

Messages take the form of Tcl lists, the first elt of which is the type of
message.

The server maintains a mapping of commands it is willing to accept from the
client at any time, which simplifies programming by eliminating most
possibilities of inconsistency. Initially, only the abendstern message is
allowed.

Messages:
error locpath message
  Always a valid option, sent by either party. Locpath is the symbolic name of
  the localisation entry for the message; in case it is not found, message is
  an English description of the error.
  After this message, the stream is terminated.

ping
  Always a valid option, sent by the client. Allows the server to update the
  last activity time if needed. This should be sent more than once every
  minute to prevent the session from expiring.

abendstern version longversion
  When sent by the client:
    Indicates this is an Abendstern client using the given protocol version
    and specific Abendstern version.
    If the version is compatible, the server will send an identical message.
    Disables abendstern.
  When sent by the server:
    Acknowledges the client and server are running intercompatible versions of
    Abendstern. The longversion is not included by the server, since it does
    not run Abendstern itself.
    Enables dhke-first.

clock-sync seconds
  Sent by the server. Indicates the time according to the server. This allows
  the client to alter its own clock so that all clients have approximately the
  same time.

dhke-first A
  Sent by the client. A is the result of base**a%prime, where a is the client's
  secret number.
  Disables dhke-first.

dhke-second B
  Sent by the server. B is the result of base**b%prime, where b is the server's
  secret number. After this, the encryption key is B**a%prime for the client
  and A**b%prime for the server, truncated to 128 bits.
  Enables begin-secure.

begin-secure
  Sent by the client. Indicates it has finished computing the encryption key
  and is ready to switch to Secure mode. After this message is sent, all
  further communication will be in Secure mode.
  Disables begin-secure.
  Enables [pre], change-key.

change-key K
  Sent by client or server. Indicates that all further messages will use the
  new 128-bit K (only applying to the stream from the sender). Each party
  should change the key periodically.

pre-account-create username password
  Sent by the client. Requests to create a new account with the given username
  and password. The client must wait for an action-status response.
  On success, the connection automatically logs into the account.
  Disables [pre] commands.
  On success, enables [top]
  On failure, enables [pre] messages

pre-account-login username password
  Sent by the client. Requests to log into the server with the given username/
  password combination. The client must wait for an action-status response.
  Disables [pre] commands.
  On success, enables [top]
  On failure, enables [pre]

action-status status locmsg message
  Sent by the server in response to actions which may fail. Status is a boolean
  indicating whether the pending action succeeded. locmsg is a path to the
  localisation entry, and message is an English backup description.

top-account-rename newname password
  Sent by the client. Requests to change the name and password of the current account.
  The client must wait for an action-status response from the server.

top-account-logout
  Sent by the client, indicating it is logging out gracefully.
  The connection terminates after this message.

top-account-delete
  Sent by the client, indicating it is logging out and wishes to delete its
  account. The connection terminates after this message.

user-id id
  Sent by the server informing the client of its integer user ID. This will
  always be sent BEFORE the action-status.

top-get-subscriber-info
  Sent by the client. Requests listings of its current subscription info.

subscriber-info user-subscriptions ship-subscriptions
  Sent by the server informing the client of its current subscription status.
  user-subscriptions is a list of userids representing the users the current
  user is subscribed to. ship-subscriptions is a list of shipids of individual
  ships the current user is subscribed to.
  Reply to top-get-subscriber-info.

top-subscribe-user userid
  Sent by the client. Requests to be subscribed to the given user. Any errors
  adding the subscription are silently ignored.
  The change applies immediately. No response is generated.

top-subscribe-ship shipid
  Sent by the client. Requests to be subscribed to the given ship. Any errors
  adding the subscription are silently ignored.
  The change applies immediately. No response is generated.

top-unsubscribe-user userid
  Sent by the client. Requests to be unsubscribed from the given user.
  This change applies immediately. No response is generated.

top-unsubscribe-ship shipid
  Sent by the client. Requests to be unsubscribed from the given ship.
  This change applies immediately. No response is generated.

top-file-lookup userid name
  Sent by the client. Requests the fileid of the file of the given name
  owned by the given client. The server will answer with the fileid message.

fileid userid name fileid
  Sent by the server. Indicates the fileid of a userid, filename pair. If
  this pair does not exist, the fileid is empty.

top-file-open fileid
  Sent by the client. Attempts to open the given file for reading.
  The server will reply with file-info after the operation
  is performed. After that, the contents of the file are sent in
  data mode.

top-file-stat fileid
  Same as top-file-open, but does not actually open the file.

file-info fileid size modified
  Sent by the server as a response to a top-file-open or top-file-stat
  request. The fileid matches that sent in the request. size is the number
  of bytes in the file, or an empty string if the file cannot be read.
  modified is an integer (like returned by [clock seconds]) indicating
  the most recent time of modification, or empty if the file cannot be read.

  If this was a response to top-file-open and size is non-empty, the file
  will be included in data mode after this message.

top-post-file name length public
  Sent by the client. Posts a file to the server with the given name. If
  public is true, other users will be able to read the file. After this
  message, length bytes are to be sent in data mode, the contents of the
  file.
  If the file does not yet exist, a new one will be created. Otherwise,
  the new contents will transparently and atomically replace the old contents,
  without changing the fileid.
  When finished, the server will reply with an action-status, using the
  fileid (which is a non-zero integer) as the success value on success,
  and the normal parms for failure.

top-whois userid
  Sent by the client. Requests the friendly name matching the user-id.
  The server will answer with user-name.

user-name name
  Sent by the server. Reply to the top-whois message. name is the friendly
  name of the specified user, or an empty string if no user with the given
  id exists.

top-file-delete fileid
  Sent by the client. Deletes the specified file. This succeeds if the file
  exists and the current user is the owner. The server returns an
  action-status to indicate whether the operation succeeds.

top-ships-obsolete selfmodtime othermodtime
  Requests the server to tell the client of any ships it is subscribed to that
  have been modified after the given time. The server will reply with
  ships-obsolete.
  The two modification times represent the last time the client uploaded its
  files, which is applied to the user's own ships, and the last time the client
  downloaded ships it does not own, which is applied to everything else. The
  selfmodtime is applied to the modification time of the backing file, while
  the othermodtime applies to the time the ship was posted by the nightly batch
  job.

ships-obsolete shipid fileid owner name ...
  Sent by the server in answer to top-ships-obsolete. Indicates the ships that
  must be downloaded, as well as their fileid, owner, and name information.

top-ships-all
  Sent by the client. Requests a complete list of all ships the user is sub-
  scribed to. This is used when the client discovers that its stored
  subscription information is out of sync with the server's.

ship-list-all shipid fileid owner name modified ...
  Sent by the server in response to top-ships-all. Lists all ships the user is
  subscribed to. It is up to the client to determine which of these must
  actually be downloaded.

top-user-ls order first lastex
  Sent by the client. Requests a list of users from the full list in the given
  order and between the indices in the list first (inclusive) and lastex
  (exclusive). The range must be less than 64. The server will answer with
  user-list. The possible orderings are
    alphabetic  Sorted ascending by friendlyName (not case-sensitive)
    numships    Sorted by the number of owned ships
    popularity  Sorted by total downloads in all ships
    rating      Sorted by average rating of ships

user-list userid friendlyName ...
  Sent by the server as an answer to top-user-ls. List user ID and name pairs
  that match the given criteria.

top-ship-ls userid
  Sent by the client. Requests a list of ships belonging to the given user. The
  server will reply with ship-list. If userid does not exist, an empty list is
  returned. The list will exclude private ships, unless userid matches the
  current user.

ship-list shipid fileid class shipname ...
  Sent by the server. Indicates a list of ships, their files, and their friendly
  names belonging to the user indicated in top-ship-ls. This list excludes
  private ships, unless it is a list for the current user.

top-record-ship-download shipid
  Indicates to the server that the client wishes to formally record its
  download of the given ship. This results in an increment of the ship's
  download counter, unless the user has already recorded such a download.

top-rate-ship shipid positive?
  Sent by the client. Indicates a rating on the given ship. Positive is a
  boolean, true for positive feedback and false for negative. If the user has
  already rated this ship, the current rating is changed.

top-ship-file-ls
  Sent by the client. Requests a list of ship files, in the form of fileids and
  file names. The server will respond with ship-file-list. This list includes
  private ships.
  This command always only applies to the current user.

  Sent by the server. Reply to top-ship-file-ls.

top-ship-info shipid
  Sent by the client. Requests additional information on the given ship (ie,
  the number of downloads and average rating).

ship-info downloads ratingtotal numratings
  Returns the number of downloads, the total ratings for the ship, and the
  number of ratings logged. If the ship does not exist, all values are zero.

top-internet-info ipv laddr lport
  Sent by the client. Prepares Internet connectivity with the given Internet
  protocol (4 or 6), given what the client sees as its IP address and port
  number.

internet-ready iaddr iport vnum
  Sent by the server in response to top-internet-info. Informs the client of its
  Internet address and port in the protocol specified in top-internet-info, and
  provides the validation number for the hole-punching service.

  IPv4 connections support NAT with the following rules:
    If two clients have the same Internet address, they connect to each other
    via their reported local addresses.
    If a client's "Internet" address is 192.168.*, that address is replaced by
    the IP address of abendstern.servegame.com, and its port replaced by a hard-
    wired table of port-forwarding values.
    Other clients use each others' Internet addresses.
  IPv6 connections assume the absense of NAT.

job type ...
  Sent by the server. Requests the client perform the job specified by
  type. Further arguments specify any other data needed by the client.

  The client is to perform the job on a best-effort basis. If it cannot, does
  not want to, or does not know how to, it may indicate that the job has failed
  without penalty.

job-done ...
  Sent by the client. Indicates that the job assigned by the "job" message has
  been completed successfully. Additional arguments specify results.

job-failed reason
  Sent by the client. Indicates that the job assigned by the "job" message has
  failed. This can happen for a number of reasons:
  + The client was not able to process the request.
  + The client is not capable of processing this type of request.
  + The client refused to perform the job.
  + The client does not know how to perform the job requested.
  On receiving a job-failed, the server will save the job for later and
  eventually reassign it (possibly to the same client).

JOBS
job render-ship ship-fileid  -->  job-done image-fileid
  Requests that the client render a ship into an image. Ship-fileid is the ID
  of a publicly-available file which contains the ship to render. Image-fileid
  is the ID of a file owned by the current user, which contains a transpartent
  PNG image containing the graphical rendering of the ship, which should have a
  linear resolution of about 16 pixels per cell.
  OpenGL1.4 clients must reject this job, since they can't render ships
  correctly.
